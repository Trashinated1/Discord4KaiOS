the end goal here is to have a usable discord client for KaiOS 2.5.x, I have no plans on fully replicating a discord client.

_if you're on KaiOS 3.x use https://github.com/diamondburned/kaicord/ instead_

### Development and testing

`npm run dev` builds the app in watch mode and serves the site. Great for testing the app in a desktop browser.

### Deploying to a device

1. Connect your device to your computer and make sure it appears in WebIDE.
2. `npm install` install dependencies, run it when package.json is modified or if you are building for the first time.
3. `npm run build`
4. In WebIDE, load the `/dist` folder as a packaged app.
